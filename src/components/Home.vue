					What is the purpose of the dental school interview?
				</h6>
				<p class="mt-1">
					Regardless of the format of dental school interview (e.g. CDA
					structured interview, MMI, or Panel interview), the purpose of the
					interview is rather straightforward and remains constant across the
					board: to assess the personality and Non-Cognitive Skills (NCSs) of
					the candidate.
					<br />
					<br />
					What are NCSs? By these we mean the following: Communication skills,
					interpersonal skills, ethical and moral decision making capacity,
					maturity, professionalism, sense of social responsibility, service to
					community, leadership, initiative, scholarship, ability to collaborate
					with others, conflict resolution skills, etc.
					<br />
					<br />
					Research has shown that, although academic performance (i.e. GPA and
					DAT scores) is a great indicator of didactic abilities in the first
					and second years of dental school, it provides, however, a very poor
					predictive value when it comes to future clinical performance. In
					fact, research shows that, an effective interview process is the best
					indicator of future clinical performance in the upper years, as it
					gives insight into the characteristics of the candidate and whether or
					not there will be a likelihood of future behavioural problems (an
					issue that dental schools constantly encounter and struggle to
					overcome). For example, it has been shown that those candidates who
					are "conscientious" and "open to new experiences" perform more
					effectively in the third and fourth years of dental school studies,
					where the education takes place in a clinical setting for the most
					part.
					<br />
					<br />
					Thus, dental schools, much like other professional schools, have over
					the past decade spent a lot of resources to devise the most effective
					interview process that will give them insight into the NCSs of their
					future candidates. And of course, for Canadian dental schools the
					answer has been the Canadian Dental Association's structured interview
					or CDA structured interviews.
					<br />
					<br />

				<h6 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">
					History, rationale, and the structure of the CDA interview
				</h6>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Recall from our discussion above that we said an effective interview
					process is the most reliable way to select candidates who perform well
					clinically. Well in an attempt to test this theory, in 2004, Smithers
					et al. conducted a study, which produced results that were so
					shocking, that it unequivocally reinforced the Canadian Dental
					Association's earlier decision to commission a "new structured
					interview based on state-of-the-art contemporary interview techniques"
					(i.e. CDA structured interview)
					<br />
					<br />
					What were these shocking results you may ask? The evidence gathered by
					Smithers et al. (2004) simply reinforced earlier suspicions about the
					ineffectiveness of traditional interview processes. They showed that,
					"a typical [traditional] admissions interview was in fact worse than
					neutral in that it was negatively associated with students'
					performance in the first year of dental training, did not predict
					academic performance, and may have led to poor selection decisions."
					Thus, it should come as no surprise that the traditional panel
					interview has been replaced by most dental school with the CDA
					structured interview, which is a more reliable and valid future
					predictor of clinical performance.
					<br />
					<br />
					The CDA interview was not only re-structured in its format of
					delivery, but it was also restructured in terms of the type of
					questions that would be ask, and how they would be rated or scored by
					the interviewers. Let us first talk about the type of questions that
					you may encounter on your CDA structured interview.
				</p>
				<h6 class="mt-3 font-weight-bold">Types of Questions</h6>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The types of questions that you may be asked during your dental school
					interview can be divided into two categories: (1) Situational
					Interview (SI) questions and (2) Patterned Behaviour Descriptive
					Interview (PBDI) questions. SI questions are those in which the
					candidates is placed in a hypothetical situations (i.e. vignette) and
					is asked what they would react in that given situation. For example,
					<br />
					<br />

					"You are babysitting your sisterâ€™s young child, who is nervous and
					upset about his mother being away. You are trying to calm him down and
					offer him some ice cream. As you are dishing out the ice cream, the
					child bites down hard on your hand. How would you react?"
					<br />
					<br />
					Conversely, PBDI type questions, ask the candidates "about past
					behaviour with the assumption that past behaviour is the best
					predictor of future behaviour." An example of a PBDI type questions
					is:
					<br />
					<br />
					Many of us have had to deal with juggling busy schedules. Think of a
					time in the past when an important but unscheduled situation arose
					that required your attention, but you had a number of prior
					commitments on your agenda. What did you do? What was the outcome?
					<br />
					<br />
					Notice how SI questions are typically future-oriented, as opposed to
					PBDI questions, which are past-oriented. The specific and actual SI
					and PBDI questions are devised according to seven competencies, that
					the CDA has found to be reliable and valid indicators of future
					performance. In other words, every question that is asked during a
					dental school interview, regardless of being a SI or PBDI question,
					will address one or more than one of the seven competencies.
				</p>
				<h6 class="mt-3 font-weight-bold">The Seven Competencies</h6>
				<p class="mt-3">
					1. Communication: does the applicant have excellent communication
					skills? <br />
					2. Conscientiousness: is the applicant thorough, careful to do tasks
					well?<br />
					3. Integrity : is the applicant honest with themselves and others?<br />
					4. Judgment and analysis: does the applicant have the capability to
					make sound judgments? Do they gather all the facts before making a
					decision?<br />
					5. self-control : Does the applicant remain calm and in control in
					difficult situations? <br />
					6. sensitivity to others : Does the applicant show empathy towards
					others? Do they take the feelings of others into consideration?<br />
					7. Tact and diplomacy : Does the applicant show sensitivity in dealing
					with difficult issues? Does the applicant possess the necessary skills
					to deal with others without causing negative feelings?<br /><br />
					Notice in the above examples that the SI sample question is addressing
					the competencies of self-control, sensitivity to others,
					communication, while the PBDI question addresses the competencies of
					conscientiousness, Integrity, and judgement and analysis. In all of
					the questions that will be asked of you during your interview, the
					competency of communication is a constant that is continuously tested
					and retested. In order to be successful, however, you will have to be
					able to know which other competencies also apply to the question so
					that you can formulate an appropriate response, which touches on the
					key factors essential for the interviewers.
				</p>
				<h6 class="mt-3 font-weight-bold">Structure of the CDA interview</h6>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The CDA structured interview is comprised of seven questions, one for
					each of the seven competencies described above. Each question, which
					can either be a SI or a PBDI type, is scored on a 5-point scale for a
					total and a maximum of 35 points by two interviewers who are either a
					pair of dentists, or senior dental students. The interview usually
					takes about 20-30 minutes to be completed.
